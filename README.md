This project involves building a multi-page website for a new local coffee shop, focusing on a Landing Page and Menu Page to establish its digital presence before opening. The Landing Page introduces visitors to the shop, providing essential information and contact details, while the Menu Page showcases offerings with descriptions and pricing.![Coffee-4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/526a8971-2447-4362-a4f8-735145a87871)
